## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Fullstack Software Engineer with a knack for solving complex problems and building scalable software solutions. With a background in Mathematics & Software Engineering I've honed my skills in languages like Java, C#, Matlab, Python, Node.JS with most-wanted technologies like Typescript, React, Cloud Computing etc. I am always eager to learn more and take on new challenges.

In addition to my technical expertise, I hold a Diploma in Typography, where I've explored the intersection of text and technology, enhancing user experiences and interface design. This unique combination of skills enables me to contribute not just to the functionality but also to the aesthetic appeal of software products.

My journey has also led me to the classroom, where I've shared my knowledge by teaching mathematics. This experience has sharpened my ability to break down complex concepts into understandable chunks, a skill that benefits not just my students but also my colleagues and stakeholders in professional settings.

Leadership and collaboration are at the core of my professional ethos. As tech lead in several teams, I leveraged agile methodologies to drive productivity and foster an environment of open communication and mutual respect.

With a multifaceted skill set that spans technical development, design principles, educational proficiency, and team management, I'm excited about the opportunities to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with forward-thinking teams.
