## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Senior Full-Stack & AI Engineer with over 10 years of experience building scalable, production-ready systems across web, cloud, and AI domains.  
I specialize in **TypeScript, React, Node.js, and LLM architectures**, creating intelligent, data-driven applications that bridge design, performance, and real-world impact.  
My recent focus is on integrating **AI workflows (OpenAI, LangChain, RAG pipelines)** into modern web stacks, automating content, analytics, and decision-making systems.  
Beyond coding, I mentor developers, lead technical strategy, and bring a deep understanding of both **software architecture** and **creative technology**.
